# Part-1
***Introduction***

A media company, aiming to enhance viewer experience through data-driven insights, seeks assistance in detecting malicious records inserted by a rival media association.
Leveraging the power of Spark for big data processing, this project entails loading, analyzing, and detecting spam within the extensive "Daily Program Data" repository.
Six conditions are meticulously assessed per record to identify and mitigate the impact of malicious entries, ensuring data integrity and optimal viewer satisfaction.

The data in this part divided into 4 data sets, you can inspect the full scheme here  [([ds_algs_specs.pdf](https://github.com/its-Raz/ds-algs/blob/master/ds_algs_spec.pdf))]
You can also inspect the full requierments for it here:

***Part 1.1 - Spam Detection***
- Extract and Transform: Utilizing Spark, load and preprocess data, applying necessary transformations. Additional columns facilitating computation efficiency should be created.
- Computation and Detection: Propose alternative solutions for handling multiple schemata. Pros and cons of suggested approaches should be articulated. Identify malicious records based on specified conditions and save them to CSV. The top 150 malicious entries should be displayed in ascending lexicographic order of the program code.
